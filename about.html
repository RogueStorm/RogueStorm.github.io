        <p class="lead"><b>I was born in Crowborough, East Sussex, England, 11th November 1957. I attended two local schools, 
          Sir Henry Fermor CofE Primary and The Crowborough Beacon Comprehensive. Like many, I didn't excel at school unless 
          it involved sport. In November 1974, I joined the Royal Navy, liked it so stayed for twenty-three years. I became a 
          software and database developer in 1997 and did that until 2013. I am a dad, grandad, full-time carer for my wife and 
          part time writer. Dog lover, cats too if they’re sociable. I like goats, don’t read anything into that, and I’d love 
          to help out at a farm during lambing but the logistics would conflict with my caring role. A keen photographer and I play golf when I can.

          <p class="lead"><b>I was a very fresh faced, and naive teenager when I joined up, November 12th 1974. Seventeen years and one day. 
            Training at HMS Ganges was followed by part two training at Culdrose in Cornwall. HMS Ark Royal and The BBC Sailor 
            documentary was awaiting me. HMS Hermes for four years, including a trip to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras in 1980.
            That's a story in itsself. I sailed south for The Falklands in 1982, the MV Elk was the first 
            civilian ship to sail. HMS Invincible next and a trip to Oz, New Zealand and Singapore, followed by six months 
            in Dubai on RFA Dilligence and then a spell on the RFA Argus, a Flight Deck training ship. My shore time was 
            predominantly at HMS Daedalus, Lee-On-Solent. My career finished with a role at RAF Scampton as part of a Joint 
            Service Arms Control organisation 
            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Arms_Control_Implementation_Group" target="_blank" class="link-scarlet">JACIG</a>) 
            responsible for inspecting ex-Soviet conventional weapons arsenals. My last official day in the Navy was 10th November 1997. 
            I was a forty year old Chief Petty Officer and the following day I had to start paying for dental.</b>

          C#, SQL Server and a few other minor technologies. I worked for some interesting companies. Balfour Beaty Rail Renewal,

          and lastly Airwave Solutions. They provide a secure TETRA radio network for the emergency services. Probably the most

          My reply always is, and always will be, the same. What is the other option?<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;After Nem's stroke in 2011, 
          I managed to keep working for a couple of years. Airwave had a work from home policy anyway which meant I could 
          continue to work and look after her. Unfortunately, I was made redundant in 2013 and haven't had a full time, 
          decent paying job since. Nem's condition over the last ten plus years has deteriorated to the point where she is 
          practically bed ridden, needs help with feeding and drinking. She cannot speak, read or write and instructions are 
          confusing for her (Global Aphasia). She also has dementia which, to my mind, makes life more bearable for her.
